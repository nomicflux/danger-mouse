# danger-mouse

Error handling for processing pipelines of information in Clojure.

The design 

For API documentation, see: https://nomicflux.github.io/danger-mouse/

## Usage

Capture errors for reporting while continuing to process data:
```clojure
(danger-mouse.catch-errors/catch-errors-> [1 2 3]
  (map inc)
  (map #(if (even? %) % (throw (Exception. (str %)))))
  (map #(* % 10)))

> {:result [20 40]
   :errors [{:error-msg "3"
             :input 2
             :error ....}]}
```

Use `try-catch` as a function, then `resolve` to apply different functions over
errors and successes, respectively:
```clojure
(->> (danger-mouse.macros/try-catch (throw (Exception. "Oops")))
     (danger-mouse.utils/resolve ex-message str))

> "Oops"

(->> (danger-mouse.macros/try-catch 1)
     (danger-mouse.utils/resolve ex-message str))

> "1"
```

Update transducers to capture errors, then handle the errors while passing on 
successful results:
```clojure
(let [collector (danger-mouse.transducers/collect 
                    (map inc)
                    (map #(if (even? %)
                              (danger-mouse.schema/as-error %)
                              %)))
                    (take 2)
                    (map (partial * 10)))]

    (->> (range 10)
         collector
         (danger-mouse.utils/handle-errors println)))

;; [2]
> [10 30]
```
